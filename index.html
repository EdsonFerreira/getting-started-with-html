<b>The web page and the web</b>
<p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML.
  Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.<br>
  The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. When a person goes to a web
  page like <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".

  video</a> gives a good overview.

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.

<b>Computers are Stupid.</b>
<p>They interpret instructions
  literally, making them very unforgiving. A
  small mistake made by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline Elements & Block Elements:</b>
<p>Elements in HTML are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
